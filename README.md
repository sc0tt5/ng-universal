# ng-universal

> Angular Universal testing with a more complex setup - includes router animations, HTTP interceptor, and an accordion component using the strategy pattern. Oh, and let's throw Jest into the mix.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

`ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

This project uses Jest. To run once then `npm run test`, in watch mode `npm run test:watch`, etc. See package.json for additional test scripts.

You can also use [Jest Test Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer) to run all test, individually, or to debug.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## ToDo

- [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)
- Additonal tests
